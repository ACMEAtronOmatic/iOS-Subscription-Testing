# Testing Subscription Offers
iOS Subscription Offers can only be redeemed in sandbox _after_ a subscription has expired. This is related to the fact that product changes don't work in sandbox. In production, an active or lapsed subscriber will be able to purchase an iOS Subscription Offer, in sandbox only lapsed subscribers will be able to purchase.
